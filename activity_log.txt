WEEK 01 Datacamp Python warmups, course curriculum, mentor call
WEEK 02 Holiday, not much of anything.
WEEK 03 More Datacamp python warmups, Pandas warmup: correlation matrices of a sizeable Finnish postalcode geographic profile (about 200 vars, 3000 rows) - Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlations back to memory, correlations with pandas (with results exports), some visualization with Seaborn - seemed clunky. See activities in repo: ~\dscipy_warmups\fingerwarmup\sdh-data-access-demo.py 
WEEK 04 More Datacamp python warmups, logistic regression with NumPy, as requested.
