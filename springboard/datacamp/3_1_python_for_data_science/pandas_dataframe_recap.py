# Reading and using Pandas dataframes
# The dataset contains Twitter data and you will iterate over entries in a column to build a dictionary in which the keys are the names of languages and the values are the number of tweets in the given language. The file tweets.csv is available in your current directory.

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import Twitter data as DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')

# Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
langs_count = {}

# Extract column from DataFrame: col
col = df['lang']

# Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
for entry in col:

    # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
    if entry in langs_count.keys():
        langs_count[entry] += 1
    # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
    else:
        langs_count[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(langs_count)

# Import Twitter data as DataFrame: df

    else:
        langs_count[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(langs_count)
# .. schema looked OK and believable

# Got suspicious of col contents, so printed it 
print(col)
# ..strange content, what language is "et"? und? is that "undefined"? Crappy stuff.

# Answer was correct anyhoo, so OK.
